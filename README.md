# email_generator
Application and dataset for generating random email conversations.

The initial source for the company names was: https://github.com/mkmoisen/company_names/blob/master/companynames/companynames.txt, I spent (too much) time finding email domains and physical addresses to create email signatures for randomly generated users (fake) that could work at these companies so that the formatting would what one would encounter in actual data processing.
